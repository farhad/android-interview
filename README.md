### The motivation 

I've created this repository to gather the most important interview questions for senior Android developer/engineer positions. 

The questions are categorized based on major aspects and tools in the Android development workflow and I aim to cover the most basic to advanced scenarios in each category.

It is still a work in progress and I estimate that I will go on for the next 3-4 months.
